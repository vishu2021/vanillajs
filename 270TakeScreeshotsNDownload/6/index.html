            JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is
            one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. It is used to
            make web pages interactive and is an essential part of web
            development. JavaScript is also used in many non-browser
            environments, such as servers, game engines, and mobile apps.<br /><br />
            JavaScript is a text-based programming language that uses curly
            braces { } to enclose blocks of code. It is a dynamically typed
            language, which means that the type of a variable is not declared
            and can change at runtime. JavaScript is also a single-threaded
            language, which means that it can only execute one task at a time.
